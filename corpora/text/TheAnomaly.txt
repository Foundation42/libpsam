The sand, forever shifting, had hidden the stone for millennia. It wasn't a tomb, nor a temple, but a slab of black obsidian so smooth it felt like frozen water, inscribed with circuits of silver that were not hieroglyphs. Dr. Aris Thorne had staked his career, and his reputation, on it.

His team called it "The Anomaly."

On the day it happened, the air in the Egyptian desert was so hot it shimmered. Aris was in his climate-controlled tent, staring at sensor readings that made no sense. The Anomaly was emitting a low-frequency hum, a sound that wasn't so much heard as felt in the fillings of one's teeth.

"Power levels are spiking," his assistant, Lena, said, her voice tight. "It's drawing from somewhere. Not us."

Then, the world tore.

It wasn't a violent rip, but an elegant, silent unfolding. A seam of light appeared in front of the black slab, widening into a shimmering, vertical pool. The air on the other side wavered, showing a glimpse of a sun-baked courtyard, the heady scent of lotus blossoms and baking bread momentarily overwhelming the dry desert air.

And then, they stepped through.

First came the soldiers. They were tall, clad in linen kilts and ornate corselets of hardened leather and gold. They carried spears with gleaming bronze tips and shields of stretched hide painted with the Eye of Horus. Their faces were impassive, their eyes scanning the modern tents, the parked jeeps, and the stunned archaeologists with a disciplined, ancient calm.

Behind them walked a woman. She was clearly a person of rank. A diaphanous dress of white linen flowed around her, and a heavy, golden pectoral depicting Nekhbet, the vulture goddess, lay upon her chest. Her headdress was a complex arrangement of lapis lazuli and gold, and her eyes, kohl-rimmed and sharp as flint, took in everything.

Aris stood frozen, his clipboard hanging limply at his side. This was impossible. A prank. A hallucination born of heatstroke.

The lead soldier barked a command, his voice a guttural, rhythmic sound. Ancient Egyptian. It was a language Aris had only ever read in textbooks, heard only in the stilted reconstructions of academics. To hear it spoken, alive and commanding, was like hearing a dinosaur roar.

The woman raised a hand, silencing him. Her gaze fell upon Aris. She spoke, her words flowing like the Nile. Aris’s mind, a lifetime of study finally finding a practical, terrifying application, scrambled to translate.

"I... am... Nefer-ka," he stammered, his tongue thick. "I am... a seeker of knowledge."

The woman’s eyes narrowed, then she gave a slight, regal nod. She pointed a slender finger at the solar panels glinting in the sun. "You harness the sun's barque?" she asked, her words slow as she chose them for this strange, stumbling foreigner.

Aris, his heart hammering against his ribs, nodded. "Yes. We... capture its power."

He fumbled for his satellite phone, its screen black. He tapped it, and it lit up, displaying a photo of the Great Pyramid. The soldiers flinched, raising their spears. The woman, Nefer-ka, did not flinch. She stepped closer, her eyes wide with a blazing, insatiable curiosity. She pointed at the image.

"You build this?" she asked, her voice a whisper of awe and suspicion.

"No," Aris said, the absurdity of the situation crashing down on him. "No, your people... your ancestors... built it."

Nefer-ka stared at him, her face unreadable. The silence stretched, filled only by the hum of the portal and the distant, modern whine of a passenger jet high above. Her soldiers looked up, their disciplined composure breaking for a moment into pure, unvarnished terror. A bird of metal, roaring across their sky.

Nefer-ka looked from the phone, to the jeep, to the sky, and finally back to Aris’s face. The certainty of her world, a world where the gods sailed the sky in a barque of fire and the pharaoh was a living god, was colliding with the impossible reality of his.

She reached out, not for the phone, but for his wrist. Her fingers were cool despite the heat. She touched the nylon fabric of his shirt, then the plastic face of his watch, her expression one of profound confusion.

"You are from the time of the legends," she murmured, more to herself than to him. "The time when the world is remade, when the gods walk not among us, but... as us?"

Before Aris could formulate an answer, a wind picked up, a sirocco hot and gritty. The shimmering portal flickered. The hum of the Anomaly wavered, dropping in pitch.

Nefer-ka’s head snapped up. She looked back through the portal to her own sun-drenched world, then to Aris. In her eyes, he saw not fear, but a fierce, desperate calculation. She was a high priestess, a scholar, a daughter of the Two Lands. She understood power, and she saw it here, in this strange, desolate place.

She spoke quickly to her captain, her tone leaving no room for argument. He barked an order, and one of the soldiers stepped forward. He was younger than the others, his face less hardened. In his hands, he carried a small, polished wooden chest.

Nefer-ka took it and pressed it into Aris’s hands. It was heavy.

"A trade," she said, her voice urgent as the portal behind her began to shrink, the edges crackling with unstable energy. "Knowledge for knowledge. Our art of eternity," she pointed at the box, "for your art of... now." Her gaze fell on his dead satellite phone.

The portal collapsed with a sound like a vast intake of breath, leaving nothing but the black obsidian slab and the blinding, normal desert sun.

The soldiers, the scent of lotus, the ancient world—gone.

Aris stood alone, clutching the wooden box. Lena and the rest of the team rushed to his side, a babble of shocked questions.

He didn't hear them. He slowly opened the box. Inside, nestled on a bed of faded linen, was a perfect, life-sized scarab carved from a single piece of emerald. And beside it, a single papyrus, covered in neat, familiar hieroglyphs.

With trembling hands, Aris picked it up. His eyes scanned the opening lines. It was not a religious text. It was a schematic. A detailed, impossibly advanced diagram for a water pump, using principles of hydraulics that wouldn't be invented for another three thousand years.

He looked up from the papyrus, from the emerald scarab, to the empty space where the portal had been. The desert was silent once more, but the world had just become immeasurably, terrifyingly larger. The past wasn't a dead thing to be dug up and studied. It was a neighbor, who had just knocked on the door, looked inside, and decided it was time to talk.
