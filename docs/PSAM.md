## What is PSAM?

**PSAM (Position-Specific Association Memory)** is a novel approach to sequence prediction that works through **explicit associative graphs** rather than implicit dense matrices. Instead of learning patterns in hidden neural network weights, PSAM builds an interpretable graph of associations between tokens at specific relative positions.

Think of it as a "reminds me of" memory system: when you see a token in a specific position, it reminds you of other tokens that typically appear nearby, and these associations strengthen with repeated exposure.

### Core Innovation

Unlike transformers that learn patterns implicitly across billions of parameters, PSAM:
- **Explicitly stores** token-to-token associations
- **Position-aware** - tracks relative positions between tokens
- **Transparent** - every prediction can be traced to specific associations
- **Efficient** - sparse graph traversal instead of dense matrix multiplication
- **Updateable** - can learn new patterns without full retraining

---

## Core Concept

### Association Graph Structure

PSAM represents knowledge as a directed graph where:

- **Nodes** = Tokens in the vocabulary
- **Edges** = Associations between tokens
- **Edge properties**:
  - `source`: The token this edge originates from
  - `offset`: Relative position (e.g., +1 = next token, -2 = two tokens back)
  - `target`: The token this edge points to
  - `weight`: Strength of association (computed using PPMI)
  - `count`: Number of times this pattern was observed

### Example

Training on: *"the cat sat on the mat"*

Creates associations like:
```
"the" --[offset: +1, weight: 2.3]--> "cat"
"the" --[offset: +1, weight: 2.5]--> "mat"
"cat" --[offset: +1, weight: 3.1]--> "sat"
"sat" --[offset: +1, weight: 2.8]--> "on"
"on"  --[offset: +1, weight: 2.4]--> "the"
```

When predicting after "the", both "cat" and "mat" are candidates, but their weights determine which is more likely given additional context.

---

## How PSAM Works

### Training

Training is **evidence-based** - the graph grows organically from observed data:

1. **Slide a window** over the token sequence
2. **For each token pair** within the window:
   - Calculate their relative position (offset)
   - Create or update the association edge
   - Increment the observation count
3. **Compute weights** using PPMI (Positive Pointwise Mutual Information)
4. **Apply IDF weighting** to handle frequent vs rare tokens
5. **Prune weak associations** using top-K selection

#### Window-Based Learning

With a window size of 8, for each token at position `j`:
```
Context window: [j-8, j-7, j-6, j-5, j-4, j-3, j-2, j-1, j]
                  ←─────────────────────────────────────→
```

We create associations from all context tokens to token `j`, capturing both short-range and long-range dependencies.

### Inference

Inference operates through **parallel graph traversal**:

1. **Input context**: `["the", "cat", "sat"]`
2. **For each context token** at position `i`:
   - Find all its associations with offset `j - i` (pointing to next position)
   - Weight each by:
     - PPMI (association strength)
     - IDF (token rarity)
     - Distance decay (closer tokens matter more)
3. **Aggregate votes** across all context tokens
4. **Add unigram bias** (base probability of each token)
5. **Select top-K** predictions

#### Confidence Building

A unique feature: confidence naturally increases as context grows:

- `"the"` → Many possibilities, low confidence
- `"the cat"` → Narrows down, medium confidence
- `"the cat sat"` → Strong signal, high confidence
- `"the cat sat on"` → Very high confidence
- `"the cat sat on the"` → Extremely confident prediction of "mat"

More context = more associations activate = stronger signal.

## Mathematical Foundations

### PPMI (Positive Pointwise Mutual Information)

**Purpose**: Measure how much more often two tokens appear together than would be expected by chance.

**Formula**:
```
PPMI(source, target | offset) = max(0, log(P(source, target) / (P(source) × P(target))))
```

Where:
- `P(source, target)` = Probability of observing the pair at the given offset
- `P(source)` = Probability of source token (unigram probability)
- `P(target)` = Probability of target token (unigram probability)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
computePPMI(pairCount, totalPairs, source, target) {
  const pSource = unigramCounts[source] / totalTokens;
  const pTarget = unigramCounts[target] / totalTokens;
  const pPair = pairCount / totalPairs;

  const ratio = pPair / (pSource × pTarget);
  return max(0, log(ratio));
}
```

**Intuition**:
- If tokens appear together **more than expected** → Positive PPMI
- If tokens appear together **as expected** → PPMI ≈ 0
- If tokens appear together **less than expected** → Clamped to 0 (hence "Positive")

**Example**:

Suppose we have:
- `P("cat")` = 0.001 (1 in 1000 tokens)
- `P("sat")` = 0.002 (2 in 1000 tokens)
- `P("cat", "sat")` = 0.0015 (1.5 in 1000 pairs)

Expected by chance: `0.001 × 0.002 = 0.000002`

Ratio: `0.0015 / 0.000002 = 750`

PPMI: `log(750) ≈ 6.6` → **Strong association!**

But if we had:
- `P("the")` = 0.07 (very common)
- `P("a")` = 0.05 (very common)
- `P("the", "a")` = 0.0002 (rare together)

Expected: `0.07 × 0.05 = 0.0035`

Ratio: `0.0002 / 0.0035 ≈ 0.057`

PPMI: `max(0, log(0.057))` = `max(0, -2.86)` = **0** → No association

**Why PPMI?**
- Automatically handles **frequency biases**
- Common words don't dominate just because they appear often
- Captures **meaningful associations** rather than just co-occurrence
- Well-studied in computational linguistics and NLP

### IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)

**Purpose**: Down-weight common tokens and up-weight rare tokens during inference.

**Formula**:
```
IDF(token) = log((1 + totalTokens) / (1 + tokenCount)) + 1
```

Where:
- `totalTokens` = Total number of tokens seen during training
- `tokenCount` = Number of times this specific token appeared

**Implementation**:
```typescript
computeIDF(token) {
  const occurrences = unigramCounts[token] ?? 1;
  return log((1 + totalTokens) / (1 + occurrences)) + 1;
}
```

**Intuition**:
- **Rare tokens** (low `tokenCount`) → High IDF → More influence
- **Common tokens** (high `tokenCount`) → Low IDF → Less influence

**Example**:

With 100,000 total tokens:

- `"the"` appears 7,000 times:
  - `IDF("the") = log((1 + 100000) / (1 + 7000)) + 1`
  - `= log(14.3) + 1 ≈ 2.66 + 1 = 3.66`

- `"quantum"` appears 10 times:
  - `IDF("quantum") = log((1 + 100000) / (1 + 10)) + 1`
  - `= log(9091) + 1 ≈ 9.11 + 1 = 10.11`

When both tokens appear in context:
- "the" contributes: `weight × 3.66`
- "quantum" contributes: `weight × 10.11`

**Result**: Rare, informative tokens like "quantum" carry more weight than common words like "the".

**Why IDF?**
- **Focuses attention** on informative context
- Common function words provide less signal
- Rare content words provide stronger signal
- Borrowed from information retrieval (TF-IDF)

### Distance Decay

**Purpose**: Tokens closer to the prediction point should have more influence.

**Formula**:
```
decay(distance) = exp(-α × distance)
```

Where:
- `distance` = Absolute value of offset (position difference)
- `α` = Decay rate (default: 0.1)

**Example**:

With `α = 0.1`:
```
Distance 1: exp(-0.1 × 1) ≈ 0.905  (90.5% influence)
Distance 2: exp(-0.1 × 2) ≈ 0.819  (81.9% influence)
Distance 3: exp(-0.1 × 3) ≈ 0.741  (74.1% influence)
Distance 5: exp(-0.1 × 5) ≈ 0.607  (60.7% influence)
Distance 8: exp(-0.1 × 8) ≈ 0.449  (44.9% influence)
```

Nearby tokens retain most of their influence, while distant tokens contribute less.

**Why Distance Decay?**
- **Linguistic intuition**: Nearby words are more predictive
- **Gradient of relevance**: Smooth transition, not hard cutoff
- **Window boundary handling**: Tokens at edge of window still contribute
- **Tuneable**: Adjust `α` for different domains (chat vs formal text)

### Scoring Formula

**Complete formula** for predicting token `y` at position `j`:

```
score[y] = bias[y] + Σᵢ IDF(xᵢ) × exp(-α × |j - i|) × PPMI(xᵢ, y | j - i)
```

Where:
- `bias[y]` = `log(P(y))` = Unigram probability (base rate)
- `xᵢ` = Context token at position `i`
- `j - i` = Offset from context token to prediction position
- `α` = Distance decay rate
- `Σᵢ` = Sum over all context tokens

**Step-by-step prediction**:

Context: `["the", "cat", "sat"]` (positions 0, 1, 2)
Predicting position 3 (next token)

For candidate `"on"`:

1. **Bias**: `log(P("on"))` = `-4.2`

2. **Contribution from "the" (position 0)**:
   - Offset: `3 - 0 = 3`
   - Distance decay: `exp(-0.1 × 3) = 0.741`
   - IDF: `3.66`
   - PPMI("the", "on" | offset=3): `2.1`
   - Contribution: `3.66 × 0.741 × 2.1 ≈ 5.7`

3. **Contribution from "cat" (position 1)**:
   - Offset: `3 - 1 = 2`
   - Distance decay: `exp(-0.1 × 2) = 0.819`
   - IDF: `8.2`
   - PPMI("cat", "on" | offset=2): `1.3`
   - Contribution: `8.2 × 0.819 × 1.3 ≈ 8.7`

4. **Contribution from "sat" (position 2)**:
   - Offset: `3 - 2 = 1`
   - Distance decay: `exp(-0.1 × 1) = 0.905`
   - IDF: `7.5`
   - PPMI("sat", "on" | offset=1): `4.8`
   - Contribution: `7.5 × 0.905 × 4.8 ≈ 32.6`

5. **Total score**:
   ```
   score["on"] = -4.2 + 5.7 + 8.7 + 32.6 = 42.8
   ```

The token closest to the prediction point ("sat") contributes the most!

## Architecture

### Data Structures

#### CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) Storage

PSAM uses CSR format for efficient sparse matrix operations:

```
Row format for (source=42, offset=+1):
  row_offsets: [0, 5, 12, ...]     # Prefix sum (where each row starts)
  targets:     [7, 15, 23, 45, 89, ...]  # Target token IDs
  weights:     [int16, int16, ...]  # Quantized PPMI weights
  row_scales:  [0.1, 0.08, ...]    # Per-row scale factors
```

**Benefits**:
- Memory-efficient (sparse storage)
- Cache-friendly (sequential access)
- SIMD-friendly (vectorizable operations)
- Fast lookup: O(log n) binary search

#### Top-K Pruning

For each `(source, offset)` row, keep only the top K associations:

- **Function words** (the, a, is): `K = 8` (limited diversity)
- **Content words** (cat, sat, quantum): `K = 32` (more diverse)
- **Rare words** (appearing < 10 times): `K = 64` (preserve evidence)

This prunes the graph while preserving the most informative associations.

### Layer Composition

PSAM supports **hot-swappable layers** for domain adaptation:

```
Base Layer (general English)
  ↓
+ Medical Layer (medical terminology)
  ↓
+ Personal Layer (user's vocabulary)
  ↓
+ Session Layer (current conversation)
```

During inference, scores are blended:
```
final_score = λ₁ × base_score + λ₂ × medical_score + λ₃ × personal_score + ...
```

**Benefits**:
- No retraining needed for new domains
- Layers can be swapped in real-time
- Mix and match (medical + legal + personal)
- User-specific customization

## Key Advantages

### 1. Interpretability

Every prediction can be explained:
```
Why "mat"?
  - "the" (+1 offset) → "mat": weight 2.5
  - "on" (+2 offset) → "mat": weight 3.8
  - "sat" (+4 offset) → "mat": weight 1.2
  - Total: 7.5 (highest score)
```

### 2. Efficiency

- **Sparse graphs**: Only store meaningful associations
- **No matrix multiplication**: Graph traversal instead
- **Early stopping**: Stop when confidence is high
- **CPU-friendly**: Cache-efficient, no GPU needed
- **Small models**: KB to MB, not GB

## Summary

**PSAM** is a fundamentally different approach to sequence prediction:

- **Explicit associations** instead of implicit weights
- **Interpretable** by design
- **Efficient** for edge/embedded deployment
- **Composable** through layers
- **Updateable** in real-time

By combining PPMI (meaningful associations), IDF (informative weighting), and distance decay (positional awareness), PSAM achieves strong performance with transparency and efficiency that transformers cannot match.

Perfect for applications where **interpretability**, **efficiency**, and **adaptability** are paramount.
