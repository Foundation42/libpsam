## Key Concepts

### PPMI (Positive Pointwise Mutual Information)
Measures how much more often two tokens appear together than expected by chance. See [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md#ppmi-positive-pointwise-mutual-information) for details.

### IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)
Weights tokens by their rarity - rare tokens get more influence than common ones. See [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md#idf-inverse-document-frequency) for details.

### Distance Decay
Nearby tokens have more influence than distant ones, with exponential decay. See [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md#distance-decay) for details.

### Layer Composition
Hot-swappable domain-specific layers for adaptation without retraining. See [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md#layer-composition) for details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is PSAM?
PSAM (Position-Specific Association Memory) is a novel sequence prediction approach using explicit association graphs rather than dense neural networks. See [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md#what-is-psam).

### How does it compare to transformers?
PSAM is 20-200√ó faster, uses KB-MB instead of GB, and is fully interpretable. See [Comparison](./PSAM.md#comparison-to-other-approaches).

### Can I use it in production?
Yes! The library is production-ready with:
- Complete test coverage
- Binary serialization
- Thread-safe inference
- Multi-language support

### How do I get started?
1. Read [PSAM.md](./PSAM.md) to understand the concept
2. Follow [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) to build the library
3. Check [examples](../examples/) to see it in action
4. Reference [API.md](./API.md) while coding
